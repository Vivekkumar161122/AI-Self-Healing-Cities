# AI-Self-Healing-Cities
AI‑Self-Healing‑Cities is an Open Innovation project for AMD Slingshot. It uses AI simulations and AMD‑optimized computing to design self‑healing urban microclimates that actively improve air quality. Instead of only monitoring pollution, it predicts hotspots and simulates interventions like green walls and airflow redirection.
