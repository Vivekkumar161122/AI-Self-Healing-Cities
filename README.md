# AI‑Self-Healing‑Cities 🌆
Open Innovation Project – AMD Slingshot Hackathon

## 📌 Overview
Cities today only monitor pollution; they don’t actively fix it.  
Our solution uses AI simulations and AMD‑optimized computing to design self‑healing urban microclimates that improve air quality in real time.

## 💡 Features
- Hotspot prediction using AQI + weather + traffic data  
- Simulation of interventions (trees, green walls, airflow redirection)  
- Dashboard with before/after AQI maps  
- Policy simulator for sustainable urban planning  
- AMD ROCm acceleration for efficient AI inference  

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
- Python, PyTorch, TensorFlow  
- Streamlit/React for dashboard  
- GIS libraries for spatial modeling  
- AMD ROCm, Ryzen CPUs, Radeon GPUs  

## 🚀 Demo Instructions
1. Clone the repository  
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`  
3. Run notebooks in `notebooks/` for model training  
4. Launch dashboard: `streamlit run src/dashboard/app.py`  

## 🎯 Impact
Scalable from campuses → smart cities → national policy, aligning with sustainability goals.  
Demonstrates how AMD powers sustainable AI for real‑world challenges.
