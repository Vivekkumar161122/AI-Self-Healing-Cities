# AI‑Self‑Healing‑Cities 🌆  
Open Innovation Project – AMD Slingshot Hackathon  

## 📌 Overview  
Cities today only monitor pollution; they don’t actively address it.  
Our solution uses AI models to **predict AQI categories, identify hotspots, and simulate interventions** (policy, infrastructure, green solutions) to design self‑healing urban microclimates that improve air quality in real time.  

## 💡 Features  
- AQI classification and hotspot prediction using environmental data  
- Simulation of interventions (traffic restrictions, industrial regulation, green walls)  
- Dashboard with before/after AQI maps  
- Policy simulator for sustainable urban planning  
- AMD ROCm acceleration for efficient AI inference  

## ⚙️ Tech Stack  
- Python, PyTorch, TensorFlow  
- Streamlit/React for dashboard  
- GIS libraries for spatial modeling  
- AMD ROCm, Ryzen CPUs, Radeon GPUs  

## 🚀 Demo Instructions  
1. Clone the repository  
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`  
3. Run notebooks in `notebooks/` for AQI model training and simulations  
4. Launch the dashboard: `streamlit run src/dashboard/app.py`  

## 🎯 Impact  
Scalable from campuses → smart cities → national policy, aligning with sustainability goals.  
Demonstrates how AI + AMD can power sustainable urban innovation for real‑world challenges.
